# Welcome to NeQo

## Intro
### To What
The *Ne*xt*Q*r-C*o*de Generator. An app I created while waiting for a mate and published because I can

### Why?
I did want to try dockerizing something and needed a simple app for that, 
making QR-Code generator seemed simple enough.

### Will there be development
I'll probably come back to this whenever I'm bored and add some features

## How to Deploy
Simply edit the port you need on in `docker-compose.yml' and run 
```
docker compose up -d
```

## Further Stuff
### Can I use this??
Im sure there are more sophisticated projects out there, but in practice this works

### Why is there still the default vercel logos
I made this in around 4h when I was bored and did not yet have the time to think of a logo

### I found a bug!?
Open an issue, or write a fix yourself and open a PR. As this is more of an impulsive demo,
I can't guarantee that I'll look into it.

### Security
Dependabot is activated and will notify me for dependency-vulnerabilities. Those will be updates ASAP
